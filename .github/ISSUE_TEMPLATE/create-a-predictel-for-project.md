1. Project Setup:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (or any other version control system).
   - Set up initial project structure (folders for data, notebooks, scripts, and documentation).
   
2. Data Preparation:
   - Load and inspect the dataset named "Data_of_Information_for_Project_Titanic".
   - Preprocess the data (cleaning, feature extraction, and splitting into training/testing sets).

3. Model Development:
   - Implement initial machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, YOLO, etc.).
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

4. Documentation:
   - Create a README for the project with an overview, setup instructions, and usage.
   - Document the data preprocessing steps and model development process.
   - Provide links to the website and reference materials.

5. Version Control:
   - Set up '.gitignore' for Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and other relevant files.
   - Create initial commits and push to the repository or github.
